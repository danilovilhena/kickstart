In minutes (or even seconds), and through simple questions, you're able to setup:<br>
âœ… README, Changelog, Commitizen and .gitignore<br>
âœ… Husky and lint-staged<br>
âœ… Linter (ESLint or StandardJS) and formatter (Prettier)<br>
âœ… CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Sass or Material UI) and testing frameworks (Jest, Jasmine, Cypress or Playwright)

**It's all 100% customizable! ðŸŽ‰** 

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Simply run the command below:
```sh
npm install -g kickstart
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

In a new project folder (it can have git initialized or package.json already, but if it doesn't kickstart will create it), run the command:
```sh
kickstart
```

Then, just answer the prompted questions and your project will be setup.
