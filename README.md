In less than a minute and just answering questions, you're able to setup:

✅ README, Changelog, Commitizen and .gitignore<br>
✅ Husky and lint-staged<br>
✅ Linter (ESLint or StandardJS) and formatter (Prettier)<br>
✅ CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Sass or Material UI) and testing frameworks (Jest, Jasmine, Cypress or Playwright)

**It's all 100% customizable! 🎉** 

## 🔧 Installation

Simply run the command below:
```sh
npm install -g kickstart-it
```

## 💡 Usage

In a new project folder (it can have git initialized or package.json already, but if it doesn't kickstart will create it), run the command:
```sh
kickstart-it
```

Then, just answer the prompted questions and your project will be setup.
